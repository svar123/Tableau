Summary

The visualization explains the survival count of the passengers based on different factors like their gender, age and the class in which they travelled. This information is presented in a narrative with 5 charts showing the likely factors that aided the passengers survival.


Design

Five scenarios were used for the story narrative which the user can easily navigate by just following the arrows.
1. 'Gender' and the 'Survived' count of passengers
2. 'AgeGroup' and the 'Survived' count of passengers
3. 'Pclass' and the 'Survived' count of passengers
4. 'Fare' and the 'Survived' count of passengers
5. Above combined factors

The graphs also show the count of the number of passengers who survived. I decided to include the counts so that it makes it much easier for the reader to understand how many passengers survived just by looking at the graphs. By clicking on the arrows the reader can navigate through the five scenarios and get a good understanding of which factors likely helped in the survival and reach at their own conclusion. From the charts the reader can find that being female, young (child, youth or adult)  and travelling in 1st class were favorable factors for survival. There are also filters that the reader can choose if they want to.


After receiving the feeback, I added the following:

A 5th sheet that summarizes the factors that likely helped the passengers survive to help the reader easily understand the narrative.
